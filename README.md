# ShowTracker App üì±


ShowTracker is a SwiftUI-based iOS app that allows users to browse, search, and see their favorite TV shows from TMDB account. Users can explore genres, view show details, and see their profiles with key functionalities such as Favorites and User Account Display. While the app integrates with the TMDB API, certain features like adding to favorites are planned for future local implementation due to API limitations.

- Search Shows: Search for TV shows by name.

- Favorites Management: Planned ability to save favorite shows locally for easy access.

- User Profile: Display user information and session details.

- Authentication: Secure login using token-based authentication.

- Modular Architecture: Organized by feature and core utilities for easy scalability and maintenance.
